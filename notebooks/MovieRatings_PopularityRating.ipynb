This is because if you follow what is going on in your community, you are tuned and up to date, and it is pretty much the same for everyone in your community, and it is not much affected by gender. Our results show exactly this.\n",

    "The most popular movie is the **\"Toy Story\"**, it is a family movie produced by Pixar,  and it got the largest number of ratings within the user community. The interesting thing is, that women quite liked it (3.5714), and men didn't (2.3000). From the results we can conclude that women enjoy and value the time spent with their family and kids, while men would prefer being elsewhere. Let's have a look at the **\"Toy Story\"** ratings: "
